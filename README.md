# Knight-move-Odin
visual use of the odin project - knights move
I personally found the example code a bit difficult to understand so I tried making my own a bit simpler (no libraries ect) the search bit is all at the top and the rest of it is just to make it interactive so may be a bit more complex. I tried using jquery despite not knowing too much so I'm sure there is a much easier way to do this
